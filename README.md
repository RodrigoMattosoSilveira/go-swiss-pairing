# go-swiss-pairing
A tool for tournament directors to organize tournaments using the Swiss pairing method, written in Go

# What I want:
- [x] To use the Domain Driven Design approach and folder structure from go-swiss-pairing;
- To use the React / gRPC integration mechanism in react-grpc-go, but using the folder nexjs-ts-materio-template folder structure;
- To use the React Material components in nexjs-ts-materio-template

# The path to get what I want:
* [x] Refactor the go-swiss-pairing Makefile to use dependencies, see react-grpc-go for reference
* [x] Refactor the go-swiss-pairing club-member service name to member;
* [x] Add a ping service to MemberService;
* [x] Replace the go-swiss-pairing gRPC server (not service) with the react-grpc-go, service, including certificates, etc
* [ ] Add integration tests
    * [x] Add `server side` integration tests;
    * [ ] Add `client side` integration tests;
* [ ] Add the react-grpc-go UI to go-swiss-pairing, replacing pingpong PingPong with the Member ping call
* [ ] Refactor the UI to use the nexjs-ts-materio-template folder structure
* [ ] Replace the original simple react-grpc-go UI page with a simple nexjs-ts-materio-template component
* [ ] Design the landing page, the members page, including logic to CRUD members

# Add Members UI
* I had to run `yarn add create-react-app@latest` to then be able to run  `npx create-react-app swiss-pairing`
